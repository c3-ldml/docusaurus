# AI Copilot Embedding

AI Copilot is supported by all handover providers.

For example, to embed the workspace into Genesys, create a script in Genesys and add an iFrame to it. For other handover providers, additional configuration may be required.

To display the AI Copilot workspace, add a value in the respective field:

- [For Chat Use Cases](chat.mdx) — add the **AI Copilot Embedding URL** value, which can be found in the Endpoint under in the **Copilot** section.
- [For Voice Use Cases](voice/voice-overview.mdx) — add the **UUIValue** value, which will be generated and forwarded via SIP headers during the transfer to the human agent.
