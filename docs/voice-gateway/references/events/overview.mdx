You can [collect event data](../../../ai/analyze/collecting-data.mdx) for further analysis in [Insights](../../../ai/analyze/insights.mdx). To collect this data, you can access Voice Gateway events in the [Output Transformer](../../../ai/deploy/endpoints/transformers/output-transformer.mdx) and the `input.data.event` Input object, except for the `CALL_COMPLETED` event. You can't access `CALL_COMPLETED` in `input.data.event` since the Input object's content is deleted after `CALL_COMPLETED` occurs. Alternatively, you can register the `CALL_COMPLETED` events by enabling the `CALL_COMPLETED` toggle in the Call Events section of the [Voice Gateway Endpoint](../../../ai/deploy/endpoint-reference/voice-gateway.mdx) configuration.

The Output Transformer is executed after processing the flow. For example, if you receive the `CALL_COMPLETED` event, write some metrics in the transformer via HTTP request.

You can also use a **Lookup** Node with the [Call Event Status](../../../ai/build/node-reference/logic/lookup.mdx) type for reusing these events, streamlining call handling and improving efficiency.
