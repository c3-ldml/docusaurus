# Answering Machine Detection (.mdx)

The Answering Machine Detection (.mdx) feature can be enabled on outbound calls to provide an indication of whether a call has been answered by a person or a machine. To use this feature, provide the `.mdx` property in a [dial](dial.mdx) verb.

In this example, the Answering Machine Detection feature is activated as soon as the call is answered, and later sends a webhook to `.mdx` to determine if a human or a machine has answered the call.

```json
{
  "verb": "dial",
  "actionHook": "dial",
  "callerId": "+49XXXXXXXXXXX",
  "target": [
    {
      "type": "phone",
      "number": "+49XXXXXXXXXXX",
      "trunk": "Twilio"
    }
  ],
  ".mdx": {
        "actionHook": ".mdx",
        "recognizer": {
            "vendor": "microsoft",
            "language": "en-US",
        }
    }
}
```

Example of a webhook payload:

```json
{"type":".mdx_human_detected"} 

{"type":".mdx_machine_detected","reason":"hint","hint":"call has been forwarded","language":"en-us"}

{"type":".mdx_no_speech_detected"}
```

Multiple events can occur during a single call. For example, on a call to an answering machine, the sequence could be:

1. `.mdx_machine_detected`
2. `.mdx_tone_detected`
3. `.mdx_machine_stopped_speaking`

## Inbound calls

You can use Answering Machine Detection for incoming calls by adding an `.mdx` property in a [`config`](config.mdx) verb. It can be useful in situations where Voice Gateway is located behind a dialer. In these cases, the dialer initiates the outbound call and then links it to Voice Gateway via an `INVITE` request.
