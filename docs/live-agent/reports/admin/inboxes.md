# Inboxes Report

This report shows detailed Inbox metrics within an account.

The report lets you easily track trends,
such as increases or decreases in the number of conversations, both incoming and outgoing messages,
the average response time from agents, the average resolution time for customer issues,
and the number of successfully resolved customer requests.

The Inboxes Report is beneficial for optimizing communication channels, improving customer satisfaction, and enhancing operational efficiency in your organization.

To learn more about metrics, refer to [Report Metrics](overview.md#report-metrics).
