# Knowledge Store

A _Knowledge Store_ provides a centralized and structured environment for managing and categorizing [Knowledge Sources](knowledge-source/knowledge-source.mdx). Knowledge Stores help streamline the knowledge management process by grouping related Knowledge Sources, making it easier to search and retrieve relevant information during Run-time. You can select Knowledge Stores in [Search Extract Output Nodes](../../build/node-reference/other-nodes/search-extract-output.mdx) to retrieve information from Knowledge Sources for your AI Agents.

## Prerequisites

- You have added a [Large Language Model (LLM) to your Project](../llms/providers/all-providers.mdx) that [supports Knowledge Search](../../empower/llms/model-support-by-feature.mdx).

## Restrictions

- For versions 4.77 and earlier, you can create up to ten Knowledge Stores per Project.

    You can view, create, edit, and delete Knowledge Stores in **Build > Knowledge**. Also, you can copy Knowledge Stores' Reference ID and export Knowledge Stores as Packages.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tab2" label="API">
    You can view, create, edit, and delete Knowledge Stores using the [Cognigy.AI API](https://api-dev.cognigy.ai/openapi#tag--KnowledgeStores).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tab3" label="CLI">
    You can create Knowledge Stores using the [Cognigy.AI CLI](https://github.com/Cognigy/Cognigy-CLI/blob/main/KNOWLEDGE-AI-README.mdx).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
- All Knowledge Stores within a Project use the same embedding model. After you [configure the embedding model of your first Knowledge Store](overview.mdx), all other Knowledge Stores will use the same embedding model. If you want to switch to a different embedding model, delete all existing Knowledge Stores in the current Project and create new ones, or [create a new Project](../../build/projects.mdx#create-a-project).
