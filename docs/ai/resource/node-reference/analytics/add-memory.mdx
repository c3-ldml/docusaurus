# Add Memory

## Description

<Beta />

The Add Memory Node stores memories within the [Contact Profile](../../../analyze/contact-profiles.mdx).
A memory entry can be any text, such as user input and other relevant details.

Recorded memories are also accessible within the [Profile](../../../test/interaction-panel/profile.mdx) object in the Interaction Panel.
The array of memories consists of multiple memory objects.
Each memory object contains:

- `id` — a unique identifier for the memory.
- `timestamp` — the exact time the memory was created, recorded in ISO 8601 format.
- `text` — the content of the memory.

Each time the Add Memory Node is triggered, it adds a new memory object to the array, updating the AI Agent's long-term memory.

By referencing stored memories, the AI Agent can generate responses based on past interactions, offering a more personalized and context-aware experience for the end user.
