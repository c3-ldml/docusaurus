:::note

  Nodes can belong to multiple categories for easier search and navigation. In the following sections, each Node is assigned to a single category to avoid duplicated descriptions.

## Settings Common to All Node Types

All Node types include the **Settings** section, which contains the following parameters:

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Label          | The name of the Node that is displayed in the Flow editor. This is useful to distinguish between Nodes of the same type. |
| Comment        | A comment that is displayed in the Flow editor. This is useful to add additional information about the Node.             |
| Analytics Step | An [analytic step](../../analyze/collecting-data.mdx#analytics-steps) to track which paths users take in the Flow.        |
